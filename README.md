Here is a project to analyze data using Tableau.

The database on earthquakes and natural disasters has been studied over more than 100 years.

After analysis and classification, the data was represented in a graphical interface that helps people understand and read this data easily and flexibly.

All downloaded files can be used and there are images for browsing the work.
